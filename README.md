ICSG Signup
==

An offline form for signing up for ICSG events.

## Setting Up

This website is a simple static page, hence a simple local web server will suffice to run the website. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) are good choices for quick and easy setting up of local web servers. If you have Python installed, a simpler way exists. Running the following command in the root of the repository directory will start a local web server at port 8000:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer    // Python 2
$ python -m http.server         // Python 3
```

## Usage

- Access the home directory or `index.html` for the sign up form.
- Access `admin.html` for the administration page where the data can be modified and exported.
